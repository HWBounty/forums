### What is HWBounty?
Are you strugging in school right now especially with all the crazy assignments and lack of in-person communication with your friends and teachers?

With dedicated forums for each subject, you'll be able to put a point "bounty" on your questions, and people looking to grind out some points will be able to help you. Why would anyone want to help? Well first off, our premium points (ppoints) will amount to a cash value, and we will let you redeed you hard work for real cash or a discord nitro reward. As for the normal points, we will be running a monthly bounty leaderboard and award the top users with amazon gift cards and more! Support for schoology.com integration, discord login, and google login coming soon.
